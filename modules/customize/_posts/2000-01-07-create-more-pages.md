# Create More Pages
Now that you know a few basics, work on creating the rest of your pages.

#### Tip
Many themes include an info page that provides tips to guide your design and content creation. To see this info page:
- Go to the **Themes** page in your dashboard.
- Click the **Info** button next to your current theme.
