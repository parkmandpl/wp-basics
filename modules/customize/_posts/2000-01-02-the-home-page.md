# The Home Page
The home page is often (but not always) the first thing users see when they visit your website. Your home page's address is the same as your domain name (e.g. ```example.wordpress.com```).

#### Activity
Write down a basic outline or sketch a [wireframe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website_wireframe) of the content you want on your home page. Consider things like:
- a navigation bar
- a tagline
- meaningful images
- a [call to action](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_to_action_(marketing))
