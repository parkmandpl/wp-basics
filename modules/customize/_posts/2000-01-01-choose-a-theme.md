# Choose a Theme
Your website's theme determines how content is structured and designed. It includes things like font styles, image placement, and color palettes.

#### Tips

- **Before you pick a theme**, reference your [organizational structure]({{site.baseurl}}/modules/plan/organizing-content/) from the last module. Don’t just pick a theme that looks cool; pick one that complements your unique content.
- Try to **look past the photos** in the themes, and **focus on the layout** of the site. You’ll eventually want to use your own images in order to give your site a personal touch.
- **Don’t worry** about finding the perfect theme--**you can change it later**. Just remember that if you change it *after* adding content to your site, you may have to rearrange things a bit in order to get them looking the way you want.

#### Activity
Choose a theme for your site.

(Note that some themes require a paid account. Use the **filter** buttons to display free themes only, or to filter by specific features or layouts.)
