# Images
Images play a big role in getting visitors interested in your site. Before adding images, keep the following things in mind.

## Choose the Right Images

### Are you allowed to use it?
If you are using an image that someone else created, **you must have the owner's permission**. Many images have copyright protection. This means  either you can't use them without paying, or you must provide [attribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attribution_(copyright)).

Always make sure you have permission to use someone else's images.

### Royalty-free images
An easy way to find free images is to use a royalty-free website. A few examples are:
- [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/)
- [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/)
- [Reshot](https://pixabay.com/)
- [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/)

### A picture is worth a thousand words
The images on your website will tell a story. Make sure you are choosing images that **tell the story *you* want to tell**.
