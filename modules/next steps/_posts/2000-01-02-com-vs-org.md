# WordPress.com vs. WordPress.org

So far, you have been using WordPress<strong>.com</strong> to create a website that is hosted for free by the company. They also offer subcriptions you can buy for more features. However, it's important to know that any website through Wordpress.com uses a *modified* version of the WordPress [content management system (CMS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system). The original version of the WordPress CMS is free. It can be downloaded from <a href="https://wordpress.org/">WordPress<strong>.org</strong></a>.

Using WordPress**.org** allows you to customize your site a lot more than WordPress**.com** does. You are also able to freely use some of the features that WordPress**.com** charges for as part of their subscription plans.

The flip side of using WordPress**.org** is that you need to find and pay another company to host your website. While WordPress**.com** does all of the hosting and background work for you, WordPress**.org** requires you to find a host. (The next section discusses hosting in more detail.)

## Transfering from WordPress.com to WordPress.org

If you decide you would rather use a WordPress**.org** installation, you **do not** need to start from scratch. You can transfer an existing WordPress**.com** website by following the steps in this link:
