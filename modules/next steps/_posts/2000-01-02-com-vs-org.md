# WordPress.com vs. WordPress.org

So far, you have been using WordPress<strong>.com</strong> to create a website that is hosted for free by the company. They also offer subcriptions you can buy for more features. But no matter what, Wordpress.com uses a *modified* version of the [content management system (CMS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system) that is also called WordPress. This CMS is free and can be downloaded from WordPress<strong>.org</strong>.

Using WordPress.org allows you to customize your site a lot more than ".com" does. You are also able to freely use some of the features that ".com" charges for as part of their subscription plans.

The flip side of using ".org" is that you need to find and pay another company to host your website. While ".com" does all of the hosting and background work for you, ".org" requires you to find a host.
