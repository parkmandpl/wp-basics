# Hosting

Every website needs a host. Right now, your website is hosted by WordPress.com, but there are many other hosting options. First, let's learn what hosting is.

## Hosting Options

In addition to WordPress.com, there are hundreds of hosting companies that can host your WordPress website. Each company offers varying amounts of help getting your site up and running. Some hosts do all of the heavy lifting for you, similar to what WordPress.com does (but with the added benefit of using the ".org" version of WordPress for more customizing). Other hosts just give you the empty "real estate" and leave it up to you to do the rest.

### WordPress-Optimized Hosts

Some hosting companies offer plans that are "optimized" for WordPress. There is not one clear definition of what this means, so make sure to read about what each company offers with this type of plan. Some are a great value, but others are just a marketing ploy.

### Things to Consider

- Speed
- Storage
- Amount of support/maintenance
- Customer service
- Price

A great resource for researching hosts is the online forum [Web Hosting Talk](https://www.webhostingtalk.com/). You can learn of a few hosting companies, read other people's reviews, and get discounts when you're ready to buy.
