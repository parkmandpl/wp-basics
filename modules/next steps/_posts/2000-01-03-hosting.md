# Hosting

Every website needs a host. Right now, your website is hosted by WordPress.com, but there are many other hosting options. First, let's learn what hosting is.

## Hosting Options

In addition to WordPress.com, there are hundreds of hosting companies that can host your WordPress website. Each company offers varying amounts of help getting your site up and running. Some hosts do all of the heavy lifting for you, similar to what WordPress.com does (but with the added benefit of using the ".org" version of WordPress for more customizing). Other hosts just give you the empty "real estate" and leave it up to you to do the rest.

### WordPress-Optimized Hosts

Some hosting companies offer plans that are specifically tailored for WordPress. These plans are not all created equally, so make sure you read about what each company offers with this type of plan. Some are a great value, but others are just a marketing ploy.

### Things to Consider When Shopping for a Host

- **Speed:** You want your users to be able to visit your site quickly. If the site takes too long to load, they may give up and leave.
- **Storage:** Do you need more space for lots of webpages, photos, videos, and so on? Most hosting plans have storage limits.
- **Amount of support/maintenance:** Do you want the company to set everything up for you, or do you want to have control over it?
- **Backups and security:** Make sure your host offers backups and security features. Because WordPress is so popular, it can be a common target for hackers.
- **Customer service:**: Do you plan on reaching out for help often, or trying to find solutions yourself? Some hosting companies/plans offer over-the-phone support, but some only offer email support.
- **Price:** Usually you get what you pay for, but you may be able to find good deals from smaller businesses.
- **Scalability:** Do you expect your website to grow over time? If so, you'll want a host who can easily upgrade your plan when the time is right.
