## Why Do You Want a Website?

#### Activity
Take some time to think about your reasons for having a website. Think about why a person would visit it and what they should get out of it:
- What message do you want to communicate to visitors?
- What is the benefit you hope to receive from having a site?
- Is it for a small business?
  - Is your website for new customers, existing customers, or both?
  - What do you want your customers to learn or do when they visit?
- Do you want to start a blog?
  - What will you write about?
