# Organizing Content
## How Should Your Content Be Ordered?
There are several ways to organize your website. Here are two:

### Hierarchical Structure
Most sites have a **hierarchical structure**, which kind of looks like a family tree. Users start at a more broad topic and can narrow down to more specific content, or jump to other "branches" as they choose.

### Sequential Structure
Some sites have a **sequential structure**, meaning users must go step-by-step, following a specific path through content. One example of this structure is the checkout process of an online store. You must go one step at a time to create an account, enter shipping info, credit card info, and so on.

#### Activity
Take the list of content you made and try to organize it in a way that seems helpful for users.

For example, draw something like one of these two diagrams:
