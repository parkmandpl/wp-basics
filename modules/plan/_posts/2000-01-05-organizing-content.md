## How Should Your Content Be Ordered?

### Organizational Structures
There are several ways to organize your website. Here are two:

#### Hierarchical Structure
Most sites have a **hierarchical structure**, which kind of looks like a family tree. Users start at a more broad topic and can narrow down to more specific content, or jump to other "branches" as they choose.

#### Sequential Structure
Some sites have a **sequential structure**, meaning users must go step-by-step, following a specific path through content.
