# Domains

A domain name serves as an "address" for your website. Visitors will be able to type your domain name in their web browser and go directly to your site.

Examples of domain names are:
- ```google.com```
- ```irs.gov```
- ```wikipedia.org```

Your free website will have a domain that looks something like this:
- ```example.wordpress.com```

In order to have a domain name without ```wordpress``` in it, you need to buy the name. Domain names *typically* cost around $10 per year. (You would also need to pay for the website to be hosted. Hosting is covered later in this course.)

#### Activity
Take a minute to brainstorm a few ideas for your domain name. Remember:
- A free WordPress site must contain ```wordpress.com```.
- Keep it short.
- The name cannot already be used by someone else.
