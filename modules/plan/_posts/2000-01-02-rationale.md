## Why Do You Want a Website?

#### Activity
Take some time to jot down your reasons for having a website. Think about why a person would visit your site and what they should get out of it.

Here are a few optional questions to consider:
- What message do you want to communicate to visitors?
- What is the benefit you hope to receive from having a site?
- Is it for a small business?
  - Is your website for new customers, existing customers, or both?
  - What do you want your customers to learn or do when they visit?
  - Do you want to sell products online?
- Do you want to start a blog?
  - What will you write about?
  - Will you write for a small audience, like family and friends, or do you want to reach a larger audience?
  - How much interaction do you want to have with your readers?
