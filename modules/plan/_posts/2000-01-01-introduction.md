## Build a Website Like You'd Build a House
Every well-built house starts with a master plan. The plan clearly defines how the house will be laid out. It answers questions like:
- How big will the house be?
- How many rooms will it contain?
- Where will each room be located?

Imagine trying to build a house *without* a plan. It would likely end up looking like the [Winchester Mystery House](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winchester_Mystery_House). It had so many haphazard additions and renovations, there are "doors and stairs that go nowhere" and "windows overlooking other rooms":
