# Create an Account
Now it's time to start building your site! First, you need to create a WordPress account.

#### Activity
Visit <a href="https://wordpress.com" target="_blank">wordpress.com</a> and click "Start your website." Follow the prompts to create your site.

Step 4 allows you to choose a domain. Use the search bar to see if your ideas from the planning stage are available.

Remember, a free site needs to end with ```wordpress.com```.

Step 5 asks you to pick a hosting plan. For now, click the link "Start with a free site." Hosting is covered later in this course.

Once your site is created, you are taken to your dashboard, which looks like this:
