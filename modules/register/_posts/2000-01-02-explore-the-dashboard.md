## The Sidebar

The sidebar on the left side of the dashboard contains the most commonly used buttons, especially in the **Site** and **Design** areas.

From the sidebar, you can create new pages or posts, add media (like photos and videos), change the design of the site, and manage other settings.

Note that some of the buttons in this area only work with paid WordPress accounts.

## Profile and Account Settings

Click the icon in the upper-right corner to manage your profile and account settings.
