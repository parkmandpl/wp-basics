## Learn best practices while creating your own website

These days, anyone can make a website with the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/modules/next steps/other-website-builders/">abundance of user-friendly website builders out there</a>. But there’s a difference between having a website and having a **great** website--one that accomplishes your specific goals by engaging visitors with user-friendly content. This course guides you through a series of activities that will help you build a website using best practices for web design.

The course uses WordPress.com's free site builder. Brief information regarding other site builders and [WordPress.org](https://wordpress.org/) can be found in the <a href="{{site.baseurl/modules/next steps/other-website-builders/">Next Steps</a> module.

This course is designed to be completed as part of a learning circle. Learning circles are free study groups for people who want to take online classes together and in-person. Find out more at [p2pu.org](https://www.p2pu.org/en/).
